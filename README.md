## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some of the projects that I am currently working on or that are already complete that I think are worth sharing.  It's worth noting that this is my personal account, but a lot of the contributions that I make are through my school account **christian-mirt**.

### [Productive Places](https://github.com/Christian-Mirt/S25-Gold)

A more detailed description with reports and presentations can be found [here](https://christian-mirt.github.io/ProductivePlaces/).

This project is being built in conjunction with six other classmates.  The goal of the class is to guide students through the entire project development process, starting with a project proposal and progressing through key stages such as design documentation, written reports, and ultimately, the creation of a prototype.  Productive Places is our solution to the problem of finding suitable environments for being productive outside of the house.  It is a tool for filtering user-reviewed establishments.  The goal of our software is to provide a method for finding efficient studying locations that fit the specific needs of each student, including operating hours, WiFi availability, and charging outlets.  The primary objective of our application is to find optimal locations nearby that are open, fulfill usersâ€™ needs, and that have been reviewed by others to be acceptable places to study.  

**Tech Stack:**
- ReactJS for front-end
- ExpressJS for back-end
- MySQL for database

The repository is on my other account and can be found [here](https://github.com/Christian-Mirt/S25-Gold).  The actual prototype can be found [here](https://productive-places.web.app/).

### [Deep Track](https://github.com/ChristianAMirt/Deep-Track)

This is a personal project that I am working on.  It is a client-side application that uses Spotify's API endpoints to display data about your listening habbits.  I initially began the project with the idea of being able to download all of the song names and playlists on my profile into a CSV file, mainly because I am terrified of the possiblity of losing the songs I spent countless hours sifting through other playlists to find, but I also have ambitions to use the data in other ways.  Another function I wanted was to have the ability to shuffle a playlist in a truely random fashion (if you are not aware, Spotify's shuffle is psuedo-random and it actually pushes some songs to the top more than others).  Something like this does not require an entire front-end with a nice UI, but I was excited to try and use Angular in different ways than I do at my occupation.  A big focus of this project was to see how well I could design the code so that everything is very simple, consise, and generally follows S.O.L.I.D. principles.

**Tech Stack:**
- Angular 19

The project is currently hosted on Github Pages, and requires you to login to a Spotify account and authorize the app to retrieve the data.  The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/ChristianAMirt/Deep-Track) and the website can be found [here](https://christianamirt.github.io/Deep-Track/), although it may not work since the account name has to be added to the app's developer settings on Spotify.

### [Intro to SWE Semester Project](https://github.com/ChristianAMirt/SemesterProject)

This project was colaborated on with four other peers.  The project was suppose to demostrate that the group was able to create a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document and follow Agile practices such as translating requirements into tasks (user stories), plan sprints using story points, being able to work together on a shared code base during sprints to complete tasks, and demostrating our progress at the end of a sprint.  This project was based off a real project, where the staff at Old Dominion University need to create a module for an application that could use machine learning to identify author names at the begining pages of text.  We were responsible for cleaning and formatting the HTML data into something that could be use by a machine learning model that we trained.  We were also responsible for creating unit tests and setting up CD/CI pipelines.

**Tech Stack:**
- Java/Gradle for code/compilation
- JUnit for unit/system tests
- WEKA for machine learning model training and deployment
- Github Workflows for CD/CI
